## Desktop

We currently have support for JetBrains GoLand (in private Beta). If you're interested to be part of the private Beta group, [leave a comment in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6342). If you have any issues with the IntelliJ GoLand Beta, you can [leave feedback in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

> **Warning:** Currently, our JetBrains implementation uses [Code With Me](https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/) links and a shared password to facilitate early Beta testing. This means that for now, anyone who might discover the workspace URL could potentially get full access to your workspace. This solution is temporary and will be resolved before the final release.

## Browser (via Jetbrains Projector)

Did you know you can run JetBrains IDEs in a browser? Thanks to [JetBrains Projector](https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/) IntelliJ-based and Swing-based IDEs can run on servers, allowing you to access them from anywhere using your browser. Here's an example template: [gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-goland](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-goland).

Simply click "Open in Gitpod" button to launch the GoLand IDE in your browser.
