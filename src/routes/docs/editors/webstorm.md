## Desktop

We will soon have support for JetBrains WebStorm. JetBrains have been working recently to enable remote development for all their IDE's. We currently have support for [IntelliJ](/docs/editors/intellij) and [GoLand](/docs/editors/intellij) in Beta, but expect the other JetBrains IDE's to be opened up soon, please follow [the JetBrains issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226455#focus=Comments-27-5125731.0-0) for more details. If you're interested to be part of the Gitpod private Beta group, [leave a comment in our GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6342).

## Browser (via Jetbrains Projector)

Did you know you can run JetBrains IDEs in a browser? Thanks to [JetBrains Projector](https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/) IntelliJ-based and Swing-based IDEs can run on servers, allowing you to access them from anywhere using your browser. Here's an example template: [gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-webstorm](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-webstorm).

Simply click "Open in Gitpod" button to launch the WebStorm IDE in your browser.
