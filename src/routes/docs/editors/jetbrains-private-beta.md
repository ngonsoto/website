Thank you for offering to take part in the JetBrains Private Beta! ðŸŽ‰

This page contains information for those who are part of the JetBrains private Beta. Please note that this page is not yet referenced from the main site, **please treat this page as confidential**, until the Beta is opened publically. Any information contained here will eventually be moved to [the main Gitpod IDE documentation](/docs/editors) upon public opening of the Beta.

Please note that **the implementation of the JetBrains Beta is subject to change** until the feature is announced publically.

> **Warning:** Currently, our JetBrains implementation uses [Code With Me](https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/) links and a shared password to facilitate early Beta testing. This means that for now, anyone who might discover the workspace URL could potentially get full access to your workspace. This solution is temporary and will be resolved before the final release.

## How to enable JetBrains private Beta

1. Go to [your preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences)
2. Select "Open In Desktop IDE" and choose either IntelliJ or GoLand
3. Start a _new workspace_ and you will be prompted on workspace start to use JetBrains or VS Code Browser

### Workspaces and restarting

You **must start a new workspace** to see the JetBrains IDE prompt. Workspaces created before the preferences are updated will not show the JetBrains prompt. Workspaces will respect user preferences on start-up. _If you change your preferences you must stop your workspace and restart it_. Also, do note that when a workspace restarts, the Code With Me link will also update/change.

### FAQs

**I am being prompted for a password, what is the password set to?** During private Beta, the password for the JetBrains IDE's will always be `gitpod`.

**Where should I leave feedback?** We have a private [JetBrains channel in Discord](https://www.gitpod.io/chat) that you will be invited to. If you don't have access please message a Gitpod member on the [Discord #support channel](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

**Which IDEs are supported?** IntelliJ and GoLand.

**When will the other IDEs be supported?** Soon, we don't yet have any official dates, but will share them when we have them.

**Do you need a license to use the JetBrains integration?** Licensing is required from the desktop client, however during the EAP the integration is free to use.
