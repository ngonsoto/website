Gitpod isn't only a browser-based IDE, or 'VS Code in the browser'.

In line with [our ambition to "remove all friction from the developer experience"](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Values-Attributes-2ed4c2f93c84499b98e3b5389980992e), Gitpod will support many different IDE's and workflows.

Integrating every IDE natively isn't possible, as the IDE has to support remote development and/or run in a browser. However, Gitpod already supports many different type of IDE, both in your browser and via your desktop.
