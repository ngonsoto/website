## Desktop

We will soon have support for JetBrains WebStorm. If you're interested to be part of the private Beta group, [leave a comment in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6342).

## Browser (via Jetbrains Projector)

Did you know you can run JetBrains IDEs in a browser? Thanks to [JetBrains Projector](https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/) IntelliJ-based and Swing-based IDEs can run on servers, allowing you to access them from anywhere using your browser. Here's an example template: [gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-webstorm](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-jetbrains-webstorm).

Simply click "Open in Gitpod" button to launch the WebStorm IDE in your browser.
